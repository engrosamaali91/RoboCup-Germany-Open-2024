In the RoboCup German Open 2024, I contributed to the ‘Receptionist Task,’ enhancing our Toyota HSR robot, 'Lucy,' to act as an efficient, guest-interactive receptionist. Lucy can now recognize and engage with guests using advanced speech recognition, where I integrated SpaCy NLP models to accurately identify guest names and drink preferences from conversations. To further support communication in noisy environments, I incorporated a noise reduction library that effectively filters out background noise from audio inputs.

This challenge was highly collaborative; I worked closely with the manipulation and perception teams, and besides my focus on human-robot interaction, I also provided support to my teammates across various tasks. Looking ahead to the 2025 competition, I aim to deepen my involvement, particularly focusing on optimization tasks for noise cancellation in the challenging environment of the RoboCup arena.
